Lesson Directory README
=======================

When Typing Turtle starts a new Journal instance, it looks in this directory
for the lesson data.

It takes the current language code, for example en_US or ne_NP, and tries to
load the lessons from a file xx_YY.lessons.  If it fails, it defaults to
en_US.lessons.

Updating the lessons in the Activity Bundle
===========================================

By adding or modifying files in this directory, you can change the lessons
that are built into Typing Turtle, and add custom lessons for additional
languages.

First, create your lessons using the Typing Turtle Lesson Editor. Export them
to the Journal using the Export Lessons to Journal button.

At the Terminal, change directory to TypingTurtle.activity/lessons and run:

copy-from-journal -q Exported lesson-data
mv lesson-data en_US.lessons

Replace en_US.lessons with the lessons file you wish to create or update.
